Expansion Impact Analysis: Touch N Go Soccer Third Location

Working under Professor Hao Ji at Cal Poly Pomona, I am conducting a data-driven analysis to evaluate the operational impact of opening a third location on top Touch N Go Soccer Academy’s existing two facilities. This project analyzes the potential impact a third location can bring, by forecasting customer attendance, measuring cannibalization vs complementary growth, and accounting for external competition from nearby youth soccer programs. 

Project Structure:
Phase 1 (Completed): Literature review, problem formulation, model selection, and a fully defined implementation plan (documented in the Phase 1 report included in this repository)
Phase 2 (In Progress): Dataset construction, model implementation, scenario analysis, visualization

Technical Approach:
A multi-model framework is used, with each model addressing a different aspect of customer behavior.
Spatial Interaction (Huff Model):
Models customer location choice using distance- and attractiveness-based probabilities across existing locations, the proposed site, and competing facilities.
Regression Forecasting:
Estimates attendance using demographic, geographic, and historical features; provides interpretable demand drivers.
Machine Learning, Random Forest, XGBoost:
Captures nonlinear relationships and validates feature importance beyond linear assumptions.

This project/repository will be continuously updated over time to reflect new findings, methodologies, and applied knowledge, serving as both a practical business analysis and a demonstration of my growth in data science.
